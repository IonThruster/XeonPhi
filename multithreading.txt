Class Notes : 
1. Multithreading and Multi-processing are 2 different ways to paralleize on large machines.

Multi Processing : 
- In Linux, each process has its "own memory + instrucion stream"
- So any communication between processes needs to be done explicitly via some "message-passing" protocol.
- Data might need replication

Multi Threading : 
- There are multiple instruction streams, but they share a common "memory"
- So one thread can transparently read memory allocated/assigned/touched by other threads.
- No Data replication needed since memory is visible to all threads.

Lecture Notes : 
- Flops is relatively cheaper than memory bandwidth
- if FLOPS/Byte ratio (i.e Arithmetic intensity) is not high enough for the algorithm - it is very difficult to be compute bound.
- One method to increase bwndwidth is to use the MCDRAM (HBM) on Xeon-Phi
    - the HBM can operate in 3 modes, 
    - FLAT mode : HBM acts a NUMA node (without any CPU), needs to be managed by software/programmer
    - Cache mode : transparent to the OS/Software, and acts as LLC
        - Least amount of code change needed
    - Hybrid mode : can partition both ways
- Memkind library can be used to control HBM allocation 
- To have better cache utilization - we can optimize the writes to "stream" without caching.
    - This can be done using #pragma vector nontemporal

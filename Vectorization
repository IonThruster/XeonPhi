There are 2 main options for vectorization on Intel's processors : 
1. Automatic Vectorization from ICC/ICPC
2. Explicit instructions/instrinsics to perform vectorized operations

When doing automatic vectorization, we can use the following flag to see if our loops were vectorized :
> icpc vector_101.cc -qopt-report

One of the drawbacks with auto-vectorization is that :
1. It is not smart always (may not parallelize nested loops well)
2. Will not parallelize if there is a dependency
3. Needs a known number of iterations
4. Function must be simd-enabled
